      "message": "My general comment here is that the point of openbmc-ci (in my opinion) is to get as much broad coverage of the OpenBMC code base as possible. If some of these new systems are just bringing in all the same packages as existing systems (with a few dts tweaks) then it\u0027s not really a great use of our CI resources. With that said, FB donates the most compute nodes and bitbake caches similar things really well so I\u0027m fine with this commit.",
