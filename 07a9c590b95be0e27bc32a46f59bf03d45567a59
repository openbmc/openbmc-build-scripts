      "message": "Can you elaborate on what the use-case is?\n\nI think the previous global branch was intentional so that we could potentially branch repositories for release branches (ex. a gatesgarth branch).  We should probably avoid removing that feature because there might be users of it (does IBM use that internally?).\n\nMost of the non-openbmc repositories are fixed with a commit number, so it doesn\u0027t matter what branch they are on.  The openbmc repositories are all pointed at HEAD of ${branch}, which defaults to \u0027master\u0027 but can be overwritten globally for the reason I mentioned above.",
