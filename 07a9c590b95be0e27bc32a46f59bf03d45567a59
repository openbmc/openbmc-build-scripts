      "message": "Can you elaborate on what the use-case is?\n\nI think the previous global branch was intentional so that we could potentially branch repositories for release branches (ex. a gatesgarth branch).  We should probably avoid removing that feature because there might be users of it (does IBM use that internally?).\n\nMost of the non-openbmc repositories are fixed with a commit number, so it doesn\u0027t matter what branch they are on.  The openbmc repositories are all pointed at HEAD of ${branch}, which defaults to \u0027master\u0027 but can be overwritten globally for the reason I mentioned above.",

If we don\u0027t use it, we don\u0027t need to set it, otherwise, we can set it like this:\n\n```\n# Release 2020-08-06\n\"nlohmann/json\": PackageDef(\n\trev\u003d\"v3.10.4\",\n\tbuild_type\u003d\"cmake\",\n\tbranch\u003d\"devlop\"\n\tconfig_flags\u003d[\"-DJSON_BuildTests\u003dOFF\"],\n\tcustom_post_install\u003d[\n\t\tf\"ln -s {prefix}/include/nlohmann/json.hpp {prefix}/include/json.hpp\",\n\t],\n)\n```",
