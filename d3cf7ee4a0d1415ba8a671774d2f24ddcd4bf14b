      "message": "Based on discussion in Discord, I highly suspect in the current state this image is actually not useful.  Part of the \"build\" is to create a user inside the Docker container that matches the username of whoever ran the build script.  If you\u0027re creating a common Docker registry for your whole team, nobody is going to exist inside the container and you\u0027re going to get an error like:\n\n```\ndocker: Error response from daemon: linux spec user: unable to find user kbuilder: no matching entries in passwd file.\n```\n\nHave you confirmed that putting the image into a registry is actually useful and works?",
