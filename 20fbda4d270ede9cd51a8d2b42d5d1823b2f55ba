      "message": ":+1: .  We should use the same revision that is in upstream Yocto.  If we use something newer we may end up with post-merge failures.  Best to contribute a fix to Yocto to move them forward even though GTest hasn\u0027t made a formal release.\n\nAlternatively, we could supply just this commit as a cherry-pick patch to Yocto.",
