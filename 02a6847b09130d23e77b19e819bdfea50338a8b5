I\u0027m happy to do it, just not sure it\u0027s worth the effort, and would lead to propagation of this flag in a way that\u0027s harder to fix and search for.",

      "message": "It\u0027s a file that\u0027s specific to one command-line option of one specific tool, and it  sets a precedent that this is acceptable. It feels brittle to me, in that if we decide we want to set a different commandline option for cppcheck, we have to create different file altogether. Given the broad impact (scattering through the subproject repos) I figured we should give thought to other approaches.",
