      "message": "I\u0027d prefer we fix this issue in another way but I haven\u0027t gotten around to it.  Nobody should be running the container as root and we should be documenting that anywhere, including the commit message.  This is only an issue _because_ you\u0027re running as root and not as yourself.\n\nThis issue is really specific to the Google workflow where you\u0027re attempting to create an internal container cache, built by a CI user, but then running it as a different user.  The container build scripts were not written in a way to support this workflow.\n\nIn order to support that workflow, we need to take on the complexity of dynamically creating the user inside the container just like the crops/poky containers do.  I haven\u0027t gotten around to porting that, so someone else is more than welcome to take it up if they are interested.",

Also is there any harm in just keeping it simple and doing something like https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71855882/how-to-add-directory-recursively-on-git-safe-directory describes and doing \"git config --global --add safe.directory *\" against the subprojects dir? Not sure why we need to keep out the .wrap files?",
