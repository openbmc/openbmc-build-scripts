      "message": "Patrick,\n\neslint-plugin-json is shipped with two modes, one that supports comments which is invoked with (extends\": [\"plugin:json/recommended-with-comments\"]), and the one that does not support comments(extends\": [\"plugin:json/recommended\"]).\n\nIn this commit, i had put more stricter(extends\": [\"plugin:json/recommended\"]) which does not support the comments in the global config, and this would be picked if the repo does not have an override .eslintrc.json file.\n\nwhen a repo, has comments in their json files, they need to add an override .eslintrc.json file that uses (extends\": [\"plugin:json/recommended-with-comments\"]) like in (https://gerrit.openbmc-project.xyz/c/openbmc/pldm/+/46335)\n\nDo you prefer the default config to support comments or not support comments ?",
