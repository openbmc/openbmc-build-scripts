      "message": "At this moment, yes;  However, in the near future I\u0027d also like to use it to start some discussions on what we want CI to do by default.  A large portion of that is tidy running duplicated checks on duplicated headers.  My thinking is that this gives us the ability to flip the flag on/off at will, and see what it does to build times over a week without needing a code review each time, and if some folks private build systems have one preference or the other (mine likely included, although I haven\u0027t really checked with my internal build folks on this) we can do each.\n\nFWIW, in parallel I\u0027m also trying to wire in clangd-tidy which also claims to solve this problem, but that\u0027s speculative (https://github.com/lljbash/clangd-tidy)",
