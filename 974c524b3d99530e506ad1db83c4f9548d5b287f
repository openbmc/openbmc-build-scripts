Can we just delete this now that we have new Ubuntu level which I assume has newer clang? If not, it would seem we\u0027d still need this to not mess up our clang format of repos?",

I commented it out because it seemed easier than making someone else look it up, but I guess we shouldn\u0027t be leaving in commented-out code.\n\nLet me know which you prefer.",
