For example in build-unit-test-docker you\u0027ll see:\n\n```\n            # Workaround for upstream docker bug and multiple COPY cmds\n            # https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/37965\n            copy_cmds +\u003d \"RUN true\\n\"\n```\n\n@Andrew G: Do you recall why these are here?  It kind of looks like the lines have been here since the very beginning when Chris Smart wrote this back in 2015, so maybe it is safe to remove these.",
