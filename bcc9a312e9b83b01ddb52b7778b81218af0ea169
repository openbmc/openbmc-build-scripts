When I start seeing exceptions coded in and such it just seems like it may be more work to dealing with people asking about fails vs. what we have now. But up to you.",

It wouldn\u0027t surprise me if we get people in the future that use a few non-ASCII characters as their full name though.  I think it should be a fairly low-lift one time change to add a new exception if needed, vs having our S-o-b not legally valid.",
