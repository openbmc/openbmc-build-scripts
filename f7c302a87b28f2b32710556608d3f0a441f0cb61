Do we need to explicitly set the config for this invocation?\n\nFor instance, should we enable `tab-in-indent`?  Ironically this file would fail if re-added due to failing `blank-at-eof`, which is enabled by default, but I personally hate as a default check.  We should probably enable `cr-at-eol` since this has come up as an issue on multiple occasions.",
