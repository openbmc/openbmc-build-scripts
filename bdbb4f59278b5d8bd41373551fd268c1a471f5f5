I\u0027ve tested it out running the current parameters over the last 500 commits in the entity-manager \u0026 dbus-sensors repos (just two I happened to have sitting nearby, not selected for any particular reason) and it mostly turned up stuff that should legitimately have been fixed.  There were some (IMO) false-positives on rule B3 (hard tabs) from inside pasted log dumps; I think we might want to either disable that one or rig things up to allow tabs inside pasted bits (and perhaps similarly with B2 for trailing whitespace, which is a not-infrequent occurrence in log messages in my experience).",
