      "message": "Maybe we should move the discussion we were having on the other file to here - I\u0027m against hard-setting the title max length to 50 and instead using 72 due to how openbmc/openbmc usually prefers at a minimum specifying the meta layer, preferring to also list the repo it\u0027s touching (OR we should change that rule). When I\u0027m reviewing code here and downstream, I tell people that 50 is the rule to follow but 72 is the real hard limit.\n\n\"meta-google: \" is 13 characters for instance, so we\u0027d have 37 chars left for the header which is often not enough.",
