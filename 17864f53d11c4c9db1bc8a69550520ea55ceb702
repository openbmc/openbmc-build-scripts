Someone found that this rule had some issues on quoted blocks, so it got rolled into our custom rule.  It is still enforced, just in a different rule, and ignores quoted blocks.  I\u0027m of the opinion that even within quoted blocks, your block shouldn\u0027t start with a tab, but in the overall theme of \"Start permissive and ratchet down in later patchsets to what we want\" I left it as an option to try to get concensus.",
