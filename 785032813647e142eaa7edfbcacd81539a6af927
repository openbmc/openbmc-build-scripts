      "message": "I like this overall, I think a lot of people spend too much time figuring out their fails. My preference would be to add what you did on line 427 but also keep this section. For better or worse we\u0027ve now trained people that the fail info is at the end of the run so changing that suddenly would be unexpected.",

      "message": "I think these lint failure end up close enough to the end that a 2nd message may make it more confusing. I suppose I could change the 2nd message to be something like \"See prior failure of: commit_gitlint\".  If you look at my example in the commit message there are only 16 lines between the actual failure and the FAILED message.  The change just moves the FAILED message up to the actual error.",

This particular change only has 16 lines, but whenever there is a bunch of prettier and/or markdownlint (JSON, YAML, MD), those tools are a lot chattier and we see a pretty big length.\n\nSee docs, phosphor-logging, and entity-manager as examples.",
