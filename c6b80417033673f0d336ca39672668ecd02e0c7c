Sorry if this is not a valid approach, it will be good if you can let me know how to find the current unresolved or remaining issues that needs to solved so that i can start from there.",

Then you can address the remaining comments up at https://gerrit.openbmc.org/c/openbmc/openbmc-build-scripts/+/72699?tab\u003dcomments and commit amend the changes to address the comments and then push that back up into gerrit so we keep everything within that same review. You can then go into gerrit and respond to the comments and resolve them after you push the code up.",
