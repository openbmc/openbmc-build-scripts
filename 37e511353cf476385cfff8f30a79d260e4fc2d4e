If someone specifies C++20 and they *don\u0027t* specify at least Meson 0.57 in their meson.build, I want it to fail.  It doesn\u0027t matter what version of meson we happen to be running during the test.\n\nC++20 will always work for us because we\u0027re running a new enough meson.  But, a user downloading one of these repositories and attempting to compile it with their native distro will get a cryptic error about meson not recognizing the C++20 option.  It is far better to simply halt them for running an older version of Meson and let meson tell them it is too old.",
