There shouldn\u0027t really be any entire-files that are exempt from the clang-tidy rules.  bmcweb does have an \"ignore\" concept for files within projects we don\u0027t own (ie subprojects) but that\u0027s different.\n\nCan you mention why you think this is necessary, along with some examples of where it would be used?  I think that would help quite a bit.",
