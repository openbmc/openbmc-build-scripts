#
# Purpose:
#  This script is responsible for determining the owner of a gerrit
#  commit, verifying they are within an approved gerrit group, and
#  then updating gerrit with that verification info.
#
# Note: It is assumed this script is run as a part of a jenkins job triggered
#       by the gerrit plugin. Therefore it assumes certain env variables
#       provided by that plugin are avialable (i.e. GERRIT_PROJECT, ...)
#
# Required Inputs:
#  SSH_KEY:  Path to private ssh key used to post messages to gerrit
