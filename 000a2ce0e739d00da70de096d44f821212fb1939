Before I worked on this script recently there was a huge mess of dual maintenance that was out of date for a bunch of machines.  It turned out that I could just put them to the default and it did what was actually intended for almost all the machines, except these few IBM machines I left in here.\n\nWhy can\u0027t we just make the default on these IBM machines do the intended thing?  I don\u0027t understand why we would have one default in openbmc/openbmc and a *different* default here.",
