This file contains regex defintions used by fail_analysis.py to capture
failures in Jenkins Code update compile and build logs. Infrastructure issues defintions
should precede developer issue definitions. Other issues are infrastructure issues that
will not be fixed by a track restart. Issues with regexes can be added as children to create
sub-issues.
