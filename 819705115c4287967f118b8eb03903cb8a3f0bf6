      "message": "\u003e Do you mean a separate method coverage() after test() and before analyze()\n\nWell, IMO ultimately the ordering should be arbitrary. The implementation of `coverage()` should configure, build and run whatever it needs to in order to correctly generate code coverage. There shouldn\u0027t be any dependency between the phases.\n\n\u003e  Can I change this here or should I abandoned this change and propose new one?\n\nI don\u0027t have a preference ðŸ˜Š",
