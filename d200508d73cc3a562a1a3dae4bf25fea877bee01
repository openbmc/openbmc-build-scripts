The net-tools one doesn\u0027t actually implement the `-I` and only has `-i`.\n\nSince we\u0027re doing `awk` anyhow can we just use the `-i` one?",

I checked ubuntu/centos/fedora, and all of them are using the `hostname` package, and they all work as expected in this case.\n\nSo I think the current code works as expected.",
