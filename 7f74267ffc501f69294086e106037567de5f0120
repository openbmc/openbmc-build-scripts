Carrying patch files is already disabled in openbmc/openbmc.  If this becomes a thing people do we\u0027ll probably need to do the same in code repos.\n\nI can understand leveraging this feature while you are developing a new feature, maybe.  We should never have patch files checked in to a code repository.",
