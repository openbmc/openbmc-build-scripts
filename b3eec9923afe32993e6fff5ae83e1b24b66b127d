CPER is a pretty pervasive architecture element and it seems that the pldm repository decided to \"do their own thing\" by shoving CPER files into /var/cper.  There was already existing design discussions around CPER related to both event log and phosphor-debug-collector, and you just blew through all that and did your own thing.",
