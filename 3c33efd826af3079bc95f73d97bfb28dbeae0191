      "message": "It appears that we could make a single call to `codespell` by using both the --dictionary (-D) option and --builtin.  I asked before about en_GB spellings and it does look like there is a `en-GB_to-en-US` builtin we could enable.  The default builtin dictionary uses US spellings, but doesn\u0027t try to correct non-US spellings (ex. colour is valid).  I\u0027m not sure how people feel about that one way or the other.",
